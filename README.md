Simple lua script that wraps yt-dlp.exe into VLC
By default it requires yt-dlp.exe in the VLC directory but feel free to change it path in the script
Also uses a powershell command to hide the cmd window that appears meanwhile yt-dlp cooks the links,
 also it uses if found yt-dlp-silent.exe that just a c++ wrapper that does kinda the same without using powershell
